# One-dimensional Fourier transform
Identify, from a collection of black-and-white images representing various object classes that depict the same object as a given query image. More specifically, the goal is to compute a distance score between the query image and each image in the reference database, such that when these scores are sorted in ascending order, the top-ranked images correspond to the same object class as the query. In an ideal scenario, the algorithm would retrieve the top K images showing the correct object class in the first K positions of the sorted list. While such perfect performance is rarely achievable, it is expected that the algorithm performs well for easily recognizable objects and remains reasonably accurate for more challenging cases. For instance, in Figure 1, a horse was mistakenly identified as a deer, yet four out of the five top-scoring images still correctly depict a deer, including one that is smaller and rotated compared to the query image.
